# Explosion-Code-Sample
A code sample of a class I wrote that creates an explosion once an explosive barrel is broken. This is found in a Unity project called Kittens With Cannons.

In the process of creating this class I learned much about how to create explosions in Unity through online research in tutorials and articles. 
Current usage of this class being used to create explosions after an explosive barrel is broken can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hv9rTo9pkRk
